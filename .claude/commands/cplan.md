Create an implementation plan for GitHub issue #$ARGUMENTS based on the chosen option from the assessment.

This is **Stage 2** of the Baseline Development Lifecycle (see `docs/standards/development-lifecycle.md`).

## Steps

1. **Read the issue and comments** using `gh issue view $ARGUMENTS --comments` to get the full context including the assessment and HC's chosen option
2. **Break down the work** into discrete, ordered tasks
3. **Identify files to create or modify** for each task
4. **Define the testing strategy** — this is decided NOW, not during implementation:
   - Which spec types are needed (model, request, feature, policy, job, component)
   - Specific scenarios to test for each spec type
   - Edge cases: invalid params, duplicates, boundary values, concurrent operations
   - What shared contexts or helpers need to be created
   - Reference `.claude/rules/testing.md` for coverage requirements
5. **Determine the development environment**:
   - **Simple branch** — Single-focus work, small scope, one agent
   - **Worktree** — When work needs isolation (parallel agents, long-running feature alongside hotfixes)
   - Branch naming: `feature/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, or `docs/` prefix
6. **Determine agent strategy** (AC recommends, HC decides):
   - **Single agent** — Under 15 files, tightly coupled tasks
   - **Parallel agents** — 15+ files, independent subsystems. Each agent gets its own worktree with exclusive file ownership. If recommending parallel, HC should run `/orch` after approving the plan.
   - **Background agents** — Long-running tasks (full test suite, linting) while main agent continues
7. **Check for risks** — migration safety, authorization changes, breaking changes to existing behavior
8. **Write the plan** in a structured format

## Output Format

Post the plan as a comment on the issue using `gh issue comment $ARGUMENTS --body "..."`.

Also display the plan in the conversation for HC review before execution.

## Implementation Plan

### Development Environment
- Environment: [simple branch | git worktree]
- Branch: `feature/issue-NNN-description`
- Agent strategy: [single agent | parallel agents — recommend `/orch`]
- Estimated scope: [X files to change, Y specs to write]

### Tasks
1. [Task description] — [files affected]
2. [Task description] — [files affected]
...

### Testing Strategy
Define EVERY test that will be written:

#### Model Specs
- [Model]: validations, associations, scopes, callbacks, public methods
- [Enumerables]: every enum value and behavior

#### Request Specs
- [Controller]: all CRUD actions × 3 auth contexts (authorized, unauthenticated, unauthorized)
- Assertions: response content, DB side effects, flash/redirects, error cases

#### Feature Specs
- [Scenario]: at least one per controller action type
- Input types covered: [tom_select, text, textarea, boolean, datepicker]
- JS-dependent behavior: [Stimulus controllers, Turbo frames]

#### Policy Specs
- [Policy]: grant and deny for every action

#### Edge Cases
- Invalid params: [specific scenarios]
- Boundary values: [specific scenarios]
- Duplicates: [specific scenarios]

### Risks & Considerations
- [Any migration, authorization, or breaking change concerns]

### Next Step
HC: Send this plan to Reviewer for validation, then approve to proceed with `/impl $ARGUMENTS`.

## Quality Standard

Before posting the plan, self-review:
- Is every task specific enough to implement without guessing?
- Does the testing strategy cover the full definition of done from `.claude/rules/testing.md`?
- Would a critical reviewer find missing edge cases or untested scenarios?
- Are risks identified that could block implementation?

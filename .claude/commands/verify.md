Self-review PR #$ARGUMENTS against the implementation plan before Reviewer sees it.

This is **Stage 4** of the Baseline Development Lifecycle (see `docs/standards/development-lifecycle.md`).

## Steps

1. **Read the PR** using `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS` and `gh pr diff $ARGUMENTS`
2. **Read the implementation plan** from the linked issue:
   - Run `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json closingIssuesReferences --jq '.closingIssuesReferences[].number'` to find linked issue numbers
   - Read the plan from issue comments using `gh issue view <number> --comments`
3. **Check plan alignment**:
   - Every task in the plan has a corresponding change in the diff
   - No files changed that aren't in the plan (no scope creep)
   - No plan items missing from the implementation
4. **Review test quality** — apply `.claude/rules/testing.md` definition of done for every spec in the diff:
   - Are assertions meaningful? A test that only checks `have_http_status(:success)` is a false green
   - Ask: "If this test passed but the feature was broken, would I know?"
   - Model specs: all validations, associations, scopes, callbacks, public methods covered?
   - Request specs: response content, DB side effects, authorization (3 contexts), flash/redirects?
   - Feature specs: at least one per controller action? Input types exercised?
   - Edge cases: invalid params, duplicates, boundary values tested?
5. **Check for common Reviewer findings** (things Codex consistently catches):
   - Incomplete test coverage — the most frequent finding
   - Missing error/edge case handling
   - Requirements from the issue not fully addressed
   - Code quality issues (naming, structure, duplication)
6. **Check for cleanliness**:
   - No debug code (`puts`, `byebug`, `binding.pry`, `console.log`)
   - No commented-out code
   - No "TODO" or "needs manual testing" comments
   - No unrelated changes
7. **Review the PR description**:
   - Summary, Changes, Technical Approach, Testing, Checklist sections present
   - Accurately describes what was done and why

## Fix Issues

If any check fails, fix it NOW — don't document it for later. The goal is that when Reviewer sees this PR, they find nothing.

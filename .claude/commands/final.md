Finalize and prepare PR #$ARGUMENTS for merge.

This is **Stage 5** of the Baseline Development Lifecycle (see `docs/standards/development-lifecycle.md`).

## Steps

1. **Verify PR is ready**:
   - Pull latest from the base branch and rebase if needed
   - Run `bundle exec rubocop -a` — must pass
   - Run `bundle exec rspec` — must pass
   - Run `bin/brakeman --no-pager -q` — must pass with no new warnings
   - Run `bin/bundler-audit check` — must pass with no vulnerabilities
   - Check that all review comments have been addressed
   - Verify CI checks are passing with `gh pr checks $ARGUMENTS`

2. **Address any remaining Reviewer feedback** (per `AGENTS.md` severity levels):
   - **P0 — Must Fix** — Security, authorization, broken tests, credentials, data loss. Fix before SOW. No exceptions.
   - **P1 — Should Fix** — N+1 queries, missing validations, pattern violations, missing tests. Fix before SOW in most cases.
   - **P2 — Consider** — Naming, performance, edge cases. Fix or explain why not (HC decides).
   - Do not argue with Reviewer findings unless factually incorrect — if Reviewer flags it, it's a real gap
   - All P0 and P1 findings must be resolved before generating the SOW

3. **Generate SOW (Statement of Work)** and post as a PR comment using `gh pr comment $ARGUMENTS --body "..."`:

   ```markdown

   ### Follow-Up Items

   ### Linked Issue

   — Claude Code (Opus 4.6)
   ```

4. **Post reference link on the original issue**:
   - Find linked issue: `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json closingIssuesReferences --jq '.closingIssuesReferences[].number'`
   - Post using `gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "..."`:
   ```markdown
   SOW posted on PR #$ARGUMENTS: [link to PR]

   — Claude Code (Opus 4.6)
   ```

5. **Suggest CLAUDE.md or rules improvements** based on what was learned during this implementation:
   - Did any convention or pattern come up that isn't documented?
   - Did a Reviewer finding reveal a gap in the rules?
   - Should a new anti-pattern or quality expectation be added?
   - Present suggestions to HC — do not edit CLAUDE.md or rules without approval

6. **Notify HC** that the PR is ready for final review and merge

## Do NOT merge the PR yourself — wait for HC to request merge.

## Attribution

Include `— Claude Code (Opus 4.6)` (or current model) at the bottom of any GitHub comments.
